Thanks for downloading Escape a Tower!

In order to run the game properly, you'll need to extract the ZIP file first. In Windows, simply click on Extract All. In OS X, the ZIP file should automatically be extracted upon opening the file.

After that, to play the game, all you have to do is open game.htm. All the other files are assets that game.htm calls for while playing.

Enjoy!
